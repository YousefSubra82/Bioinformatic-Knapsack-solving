# Bioinformatic-Knapsack-solving
Knapsack Problem Solver with Genetic Algorithm
This project solves the classic Knapsack Problem using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The objective is to select items with maximum benefit without exceeding the knapsack's weight capacity. The GA optimizes the solution through a population of potential answers, evolving via selection, crossover, and mutation.

Key features include:

A Streamlit-based interactive interface for dynamically defining test cases and item properties.
Efficient handling of multiple test cases with customizable knapsack size, item weights, and benefits.
Visualization of results, showing the optimal solution for each test case.
